1. Which registers contain arguments to functions?
   For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
A: a0-a7; a2

2. Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main?
   Where is the call to g?
A: No calling

3. At what address is the function printf located?
A: 34:	5f8080e7          	jalr	1528(ra) # 628 <printf>

4. What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
A: 0x1

5. Run the following code.
   	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
   What is the output?
   The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian.
   If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output?
   Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?
A: "HE110 World"; 0x00646c73; No

6. In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='?
(note: the answer is not a specific value.)
   Why does this happen?
A: Value of register a2; Undefined memory
